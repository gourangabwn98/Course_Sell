# CodeMaster Pro

CodeMaster Pro is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This project aims to provide a platform for users to manage their coding projects and collaborate with others.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express. It handles API requests and interacts with the MongoDB database.

- **src/app.js**: Entry point of the backend application. Initializes the Express app and connects to the database.
- **src/controllers/index.js**: Contains functions to handle API requests, such as user management.
- **src/models/index.js**: Defines Mongoose models, including the User model.
- **src/routes/index.js**: Sets up API routes for user-related operations.
- **src/config/db.js**: Contains the database connection logic.
- **package.json**: Lists dependencies and scripts for the backend.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React. It provides a user interface for interacting with the backend.

- **src/App.js**: Main component that sets up routing and renders the application layout.
- **src/index.js**: Entry point of the frontend application.
- **src/components/Navbar.js**: Navigation component for the application.
- **src/pages/Home.js**: Displays the main content of the homepage.
- **src/utils/api.js**: Utility functions for making API calls to the backend.
- **package.json**: Lists dependencies and scripts for the frontend.
